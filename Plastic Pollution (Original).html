<h1 id="frankruhllibre"> The Plight of Plastic Pollution <br></h1>

<p id="roboto">
“When the Earth becomes a dead wasteland, there would be no one at hand. When chaos leads to havoc, disease and illness spreads.
 In an exhausted world, only smoke and plastic rules civilization. There is no human intervention nor hope that can be mentioned...”<br>
<br>
“The diminished line divides the ocean and heavens when the sailor peers through the telescope, as he treads in exile away from the plague.
 Formations of circular motion bend and swivel on the surface to mourn the clouds hidden by ash. The surface wears a mask of white and clear 
 rubble which tilts the wooden log to God’s abode.”<br>
<br>
“The dead man bows on his knees in the clouds and sees the world drown in debris. God is nowhere to be seen yet. The soul, to be judged,
 consistently marks a different territory and rotates 2 white spheres to the immense white sphere decorated with black air and white grounds, 
 whiter than the skies.”<br>
<br>
"How is it possible that this is natural…"

<p id="roboto">
Throughout the globe, plastic pollution has been a major issue that wreaks havoc on the lives of many.
The health implications of contamination have been known ranging from diseases spread (from 
the environment to the body). The causes for oblivion vary; however, the chaos created brings shame to 
mankind. The ethical argument fits in the field of environmental damage considering that humans have 
contributed to the growth of plastic over the years since the 20th CE. Also, the documented effects of 
plastic pollution, while being credible and objective, provide the fundamental need for the population 
to become more aware of global issues.

It is no wonder that health issues are pertinent in the race of plastic commercialization. 
As an example, the effects of plastic pollution shown below are diverse in negative possibilities 
such as: 
</p>

<ul id="roboto">
<li>Eye irritation</li>
<li>Breathing difficulties</li>
<li>Liver dysfunction</li>
<li>Skin diseases</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li>Skin diseases</li>
</ul>

<p id="roboto">
Also, the variety of health issues and economic disparities are occuring in the present state due to only 50% of the plastic being disposable.

What is responsible for the harmful nature of plastic?<br><br>
</p>

<p id="roboto">
The use of carcinogenic and neurotoxic additives such as Bisphenol A, Antiminitroxide, phthalates, and polyvinyl chloride are <br>
additives responsible for the health and environmental implications from hormone related diseases and soil contamination.<br>

With the common use and the globalization of plastic through travelling in ocean currents, from vehicles to be ended up in dump yards, 
from factories and industries to supermarkets, and from people to the dumping pound, the frequency of seeing plastic has increased. In 
restaurants, the use of plastic cups, straws and bags in malls, commercial areas, vendors and retailers have increased 
over the years since 1907. It is also surprising that 1 trillion single use plastic bags are used every year with 480 billion plastic bottles 
sold in 2016. It is also frightening that 4.5 trillion people litter cigarette butts annually (according to earthday.org).


More about the chemical properties of plastics:  <br><br> 
Many toxic chemicals in plastic are spread through the environment in air, land and water bodies which have a profound effect on the biomass of 
organisms from those in oceans to stray animals ingesting plastic thrown on the streets. The use of toxic chemicals such as dioxins, formaldehyde,
and polycarbonate in plastic production gives plastic it’s toxic and deadly nature to the environment. Also, added toxic 
substances are release from factories to the environment. Such substances are dioxins,
carbon monoxide, and cyanide contributing to air pollution. they also pose as 
anti biological agents to both humans and other living animals. 
Also, with organisms ingesting plastic substances, the risk of microplastics entering the food chains is amplified with consumers and predators eating<br>
animals with plastic in their bodies. 
<br><br>

Soil: 

<br><br>

<br>
When plastic is littered on the soil, the toxins from the pollutants seep in which leads to high soil acidity and toxicity. This is damaging to plants 
and other important mineral providing creatures such as worms and ants. The effects are followed on from the death of plants to the lack of oxygen for 
life. Also, the ingestion of plastic from organisms in the soil results in the death and extinction of many species. It is also alarming that the
soil on Earth cannot be replenished like wind and solar energy. Like trees and farm crops, the littering of plastic will also affect the purity of groundwater.
Likewise, the food grown from these crops in toxic soil is undoubtedly hazardous. The wasteland with the valleys 
of plastic waste will pile up and up to produce an unbearable stench decreasing tourism ans safety. The breaking down of plastic in landfills and by 
other bacteria into micro and nano particles, with the described effects, are unstable for the environment.
<br><br>

Landfills:

<br><br>

<br>
Similarly to soil related issues, the accumulation of different types of plastics, disposed by residents and people, in landfills, are evident to lead to a toxic 
environment. It is not credible that landfills and other disposal sites would be sustainable for the prevention of plastic from seeping in the environment. From
the disposal plastic products, the breaking down plastic to release methane and other greenhouse gases is also common through bacteria such as pseudomonas, 
flavobacteria, and nylon-eating bacteria. These organisms are equipped with certain enzymes (biological agents which affect the rate of chemical reactions in organisms) 
to break down plastic. However, the rate at which plastic is broken down is very slow, taking 50-600 years due to the strength of the bonds between molecular
compounds in the plastic substance. Also, while decomposition takes place, toxic substances are released in the soil leading to the effects described. The microplastic 
found in soil and in landfills are also shockingly higher than those found in water. The generated plastic, also, can be distributed quickly through vectors (natural 
and artificial means of transportation) spreading toxic substances quickly. Lastly, various types of research have been  
conducted to support the fact that plastic pollution is destructive in many categories.

Oceans:<br>

<br>

<br>
There are numerous examples in India that mention about plastic polluting oceans (in the Indian Ocean). Specifically, the effect of toxic chemicals
mixing with water results in intestinal issues occuring in whales, dolphins, and other fishes and marine animals. 8 million tonnes
(8000 million kgs) of plastic enter the Earth's water bodies annually. Also, the popular prediction that there would be more fish than plastic in water by 2050 is close
to being accurate (presently, the year is 2020). Since plastic is non-biodegradable, it instead breaks down into microplastics that are mistakenly consumed by sea animals 
such as turtles, sharks, and land animals. This occurs since microplastics are very small (as small from 0.8 to 5mm; sometimes, they can be several nanometers). 
With this, not only are animals ingesting plastic, but toxic chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls are released impacting the purity of water and 
the health of the organisms living in water bodies. The effect of poisoning in fish is also proportional to the decreased health quality in humans who consume such fish.
It is also flummoxing that 80% of the plastic dumped in water bodies is actually from urban settlements (from landfills, trash cans, ship discharges and 
trucks). Also, plastic substances have been submerged in further parts Earth such as the Antarctic ocean due to the water currents while 95% of the total plastic in 
oceans is submerged underneath.

<p id="roboto">
Also, with the strong use of plastic in large quantities, the risks are detrimental to human and animal health with more amounts of diseases caused by the toxic 
substances found. <br>
<br>
Substances such as styrofoam contain styrene and benzene which are toxic in nature (benzene is a known carcinogen with high toxicity). Also, their effects on the
respiratory system, nervous system, kidneys, liver, eyes, skin and the endocrine system are lethal with hormonal disorders also being a complication. With the heating
of plastic substances, the ability for the toxic substances to seep in to the human body increases. Specifically, the burning of plastics in developing systems increases
the emissions of toxic substances in the atmosphere leading to health complications, especially in women and children. 
<br><br>
The littering of plastic also serves as breeding grounds for parasites and other insects such as mosquitos increasing the likelihood of vector borne diseases (malaria and dengue). 
These infections can also spread due to sewer blockages.
<br><br>
With phthalates used in plastic to increase its flexibility, their presence is also in Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC). The use of PVCs in plastic toys with other substances such as 
dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di-n- octyl- phthalate (DNOP), and di-isodecyl phthalate (DIDP) have severe effects to the reproductive system of males and females with deformities in 
babies. Other hormonal issues such as insulin resistance and obesity are prevalent with endocrine system disorders. The lethality of plastic is exaggerated with phthalates used
in shampoo and soap products. <br>
<br>
Neurotoxic and carcinogenic substances found in plastic (which is littered in water and land while being burnt to the air) can easily spread through different mediums such as 
consumption of plastic infested animals and ingestion of polluted water (which are both fatal to the human body). Also, the inhalation of microplastic in the air
is the most fatal since many small particles of plastic can end up in the body faster through inhalation. The secretion of toxic substances from plastic (which have strong 
synthetic chemical bonds) taking years to decompose lead to the increase in microplastic substances in the atmosphere. Also with humans and animals,
suffocation and starvation are resulting effects of ingesting plastic.  The use of halogenated compounds in the production of plastic 
(such as bromine and chlorine) is also toxic if burnt (toxic substances can diffuse to the air easily). <br>
<br>
Below are the health effects of the harmful chemicals found in plastic on human (and animal) health. <br>

<i>When cause and effect collide…</i>
</p>
<br>

<p id="roboto">
For a large scale issue such as plastic pollution, especially in India, there is always a causality factor to consider when judging a man made problem. 
Those associated with plastic contamination and littering are mostly tied to the workings of man in mismanaging the disposal of plastic. Of course, plastic 
ingested by animals can travel across the food chain and become dispersed; however, who would be to blame for plastic to be eaten by animals? </p>

<p style="font-size: 40px; color: #2d10c2;">Littering: </p>
<img src="https://previews.123rf.com/images/501room/501room1209/501room120900054/15503819-abstract-dirty-paint.jpg" class="center" height="300px;" width="300px;">


<p id="roboto">
A fundamental factor for domestic plastic pollution in today’s world. This is very common to the point where a styrofoam or polythene bag can be seen
within less than 17 footsteps of gap. Now, it is possible to shake the notions off of littering being a “major” contributor to plastic. There are indeed 
other sources as well (such as plastic manufacturing units which release harmful toxins) to be discussed; however, the minimum and most effortless contribution 
to the environment is to dispose of plastic in an appropriate bin. <br><br>

But think again, when mentioning about landfills of plastic where people's trash accumulate, the surge of toxic chemicals into the soil and the atmosphere is 
significantly increased. Especially during summers in hot weather where plastic melts faster.

Plastic pollution is caused by the mass production and distribution of plastic goods (bags and bottles) from factories to people (which is the reason why 
plastic is a common commodity). It is also startling that 300 million tonnes of plastic is produced annually with 50% being single use plastics which cannot
be recycled/reused. Also,with the use of 500 billion plastic bags every year (with 1 million used every minute), the commonality of plastic is elevated to
an indescribable standard. Out of which in India, 9.46 million tonnes of plastic is generated annually where similarly, 43% are single use plastics. Also, 
8.3 billion tonnes of plastic has been produced since 1950 where the plastic material is not completely decomposed which means that microplastic particles 
in the air are common posing a risk for ingestion and suffocation. <br><br>
 
With the introduction of billions of tonnes of single use plastic (which is 40% of the total plastic on Earth), the destructive effects of their disposal are well known. 
</p>


<ul id="roboto">
<li>When there is a frictional force between the tires of the car and the ground, thousands of tiny pieces of microplastic are dispersed on the road and the air.</li>
<li>Washing/drying synthetic clothing (nylon and polyester) releases millions of microplastic particles in, water, air and in drainage systems (which blocks sewer waste from circulating)</li>
<li>The dispersion of plastic by rivers and wind amplified the global effects of plastic use on the environment (with plastic toys flowing through water currents to end up in different regions of the globe)</li>
<li>With urbanization, more plastic is demanded as a cheap and readily available building material to create more infrastructure and homes</li>
<li>The affordability and economic benefits of using plastic as a cheap material has increased its demand causing manufacturers to produce triple the amount of plastic (than decades ago)</li>
<li>Decomposition of plastic takes 50-600 years depending on the chemical strength of its bonds</li>
</ul>

<p id="roboto">
Tourism and business related activities are also affected by plastic pollution and with decreased tourism, the income for a country is significantly reduced and the economic 
stability would decrease. Also, 13 billion dollar worth of damage could be done to the environment due to littering.

The concept of waste management has popularized over the years with the implementation of sustainable methods that provide an advantage to both the practitioner and the environment. 
Through an induced symbiotic relationship, the rate of change would increase since it provides a benefit to the person. Even though many initiatives and proposals by multinational 
organizations such as the UN take place, it is also possible to contribute to change in a small way which does not require much effort or time. </p>

<ul id="roboto">
<li>Reduce the accumulation of single use plastics in a household (such as plastic plates, 
cups and bags). Instead, replace them with other long lasting materials such as 
jute (for bags), glass (for plates) and silver (for cups). In this way, less money 
would be spent on plastic goods and regularly using these materials would lead to 
better organization of goods in a household. Also, less plastic would be used.</li>
<br>
<li>Carry a permanent use silver/plastic water bottle for commuting and
 drink water from public sources if possible. If these sources are unhygienic, 
 using filtered water/reducing the number of plastic bottles used/recycling enough 
 plastic bottles are also effective methods.</li>
<br>
<li>Use metal cutlery for consuming food and bring a lunch box for eating/taking
 food from a restaurant.</li>
<br>
<li>Arrange home waste into different categories (disposable and recyclable/biodegradable
 and nonbiodegradable/ artificial and natural waste) in order to extract materials which 
 can either be reused or recycled. Also keep in mind of credible recycling companies who would 
 handle waste efficiently.</li>
<br>
<li>Buy food products in bulk instead of individually since bulk packaging uses more cardboard rather 
than plastic.</li>
<br>
<li>Support sustainable companies/manufacturers financially and socially rather than buying products
from non-sustainable companies. For major change, spread awareness about supporting the right organizations.</li>
<br>
<li>Stop using plastic straws (use steel/reusable straws instead)</li>
<br>
<li>Reduce the frequency of chewing gum</li>
<br>
<li>Eat raw fruits/fruit squeezed juice instead of processed juice from markets </li>
<br>
<li>Reduce the consumption of frozen food (numerous health benefits are involved)</li>
<br>
