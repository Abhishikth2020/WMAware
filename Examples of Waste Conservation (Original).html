<h1 id="frankruhllibre"> Examples of action to improve Waste Conservation </h1>

<p id="roboto">
Example 1: India <br>
In October of 2019, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, intended to ban single use plastics by 2022;
however, the effectiveness of the ban is questioned with it’s possibility to disrupt the food, consumer 
goods, and plastic production industries. Jobs were also at risk in plastic production factories. According to views from news articles, 
to ensure a sustainable model, targeting people more, instead of manufacturing companies, to take responsibility to dispose plastic properly
and to reduce the usage of plastic is a more effective solution. When less people buy and use plastic goods, manufacturing 
companies lose profits and are pressured to find environmentally friendly alternatives to plasic for restoring their profits).

Example 2: China <br>
Shezen, a city in China, initiated a waste to energy facility in response to a predicted a population of 12 
million people in 2025. The facility, manufactured by Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects and Gottlieb Paludan 
Architects, intends to burn 5000 metric tonnes of waste per day. This would serve as an eco-friendly model for 
other cities to follow and is sustainable since the large amounts of waste used by people can be used in a 
productive and beneficial manner. However, the release of greenhouse gases from burning waste is a disadvantage 
which can cause air polluion. Additionally, treatment of gases before disposal is also important.

<p id="roboto">
Example 3: Brazil <br>
With Rio de Janeiro, a city in Brazil, hosting the Summer Olympics Game in 2016, combating pollution and treating
waste were important for creating a clean city for the games. On the other hand, there were also many instances of people 
recklessly throwing trash in inappropriate areas. The games on August 5th, 2016 used barriers for waste collection with 
GPS systems to map water currents with waste. These measures were beneficial to control the amount of waste polluted; however,
multiple clean up operations would be needed (increasing costs and affecting economy) for clearing plastic completely and
regulating citizen behavior is needed.
