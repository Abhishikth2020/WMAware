The effects of plastic pollution has been known for years since 1907 with plastic 
being found in the intestines of animals such as dogs, buffalos and many marine 
animals such as turtles and whales. Plastic was also known to clog drains and 
release toxins in the soil. Being made from a polymeric material such as propylene
 (component of petroleum) compounds joined together to form a monomer (polypropylene),
  the energy to break these bonds is very high making it difficult for decomposition to
   take place. Moreover, the improper disposal of plastic such as being thrown out of a vehicle,
    thrown on the ground, and not being put in respective recycling bins has led to the 
    increase in plastic pollution. Today, 420 million tons of plastic is being produced
     out of which 14 million tons are disposed of in water bodies yearly. Mostly found in
      Asian and African countries with inefficient waste management (garbage systems) systems,
       the worldwide effects of plastic pollution had even brought the attention of the United
        Nations to make a global treaty. Also, being made from fossil fuels, the effects of 
        plastic were also innovative and revolutionary. During World War 2 (1939-1945), plastics
         were influential with the Society of the Plastics Industry forming. From February 1942, 
         the plastic industry was beneficial for making war related tools. Also, plastics were used 
         to make medical devices such as respirators and syringes with being a cheap material for making
          rocket chassis to enable cheap and efficient space travel. However, the rise of throwing single 
          use plastics over time led to the abundance of plastic substances in ecosystems (taking more than 100 years to break down).

The implications of plastic being disposed without care impacted the world in negative ways from the accumulation
 of microplastics in the respiratory system leading to clogging and blockage of the alveoli and bloodstream (leading 
 to shortness of breath). Also, the chances of cancer and cardiovascular disease from microscopic plastic
  particles inhaled is common. With only 9% of plastic recycled each year, the remaining particles of plastic are
   left to damage organisms and the environment by building up in water and air. Most surprisingly, when plastic
    is submerged in water, the small particles disperse leading to congestion in the digestive systems of ocean 
    organisms. It is also concerning that a single styrofoam cup takes 50 years to completely decompose. When making this 
    website, I was inspired to reduce the effects of plastic pollution in my community and to inform other residents, 
    teenagers and older people about the importance of managing biodegradable and non-biodegradable (plastic) waste 
    effectively. With this, the recyclability of plastics, paper, and steel would be preserved while biodegradable
     materials can be used to make manure (to improve plant growth). I also intended to inform readers and raise awareness
      about plastic pollution and the consequences of inefficient waste management. I have also gathered valuable
       information from direct interviews with residents who practice waste regulation and who are aware of 
       environmental issues. Compiling research from many websites and articles to deliver reliable content also took place. 
       In today’s world of globalization and sustainability, it is vital for eco-friendly practices to take place 
       which would lead to increased popularity for conserving the enviornment and preserving resources.

Lastly, I want to mention about waste management. In high income countries, management methods are more effective and safe compared to 
low income (developing countries). 
Different companies such as WM (from the US) also make profits using waste management. Being a combination 
of collection, transportation, and disposing waste, waste management safely and efficiently disposes or 
recycles waste material. Today, methods such as using landfills, combustion, recycling, plasma gasification, 
composting, minimization (most viable and common for residents), and energy conversion are used to manage waste
 for productive purposes. Also, the importance of mass waste management is understood today with numerous 
 startups and movements in India. It is impressive how environmental innovation is a major trend today which
  teaches about sustainability and productivity (for wastes to be useful). In other words, this is a way of creating
   something from nothing and I believe that this practice is beneficial for the 
   environment and the advancement of adaptation and ingenuity.</p>

   Why was this website created?</p>
   
<p id="roboto" style="background-color: #dddddd; color: black;" align="left">   
While shifting through my daily life and when looking out of the windows on the bus, I was not surprised to find armies 
plastic covers, bags, bottles, and wrappers lying on dirt grounds. I have seen this frequently; but, I also felt curious to 
know why. When travelling to restaurants and shops, the amount of plastic lying on the roadsides and in the bushes of abandoned 
purpose was maximum. Also, when recently coming back from the US, I noticed that different bins for recycling 
(blue bin) and bio waste (green bin) were not seen often nor was there waste segregation. 
Instead, many residents (from other apartment complexes and communities) dispose all of their waste in one bin while pickup trucks 
do not segregate waste (or people wrap all of their waste in a bag and dump it in the truck). 
   <br>
   <br>
While pondering about this, I have decided to use practices in my community as examples of how waste can be managed and regulated.
I have gathered information from residents and committee representatives about their perspective on plastic pollution
and waste management. Efficient waste management systems in households and residences can not only reduce plastic, but it can also
effectively dispose of other wastes in respective categories. When waste is disposed through segregation, bio and non-biodegradable 
materials can be separated, biodegradable materials can be burnt for methane (energy production) or made into compost for plants, and 
non-biodegradable waste can be recycled, treated (toxic chemicals present) and reused. In simple terms, each category of waste is utilized 
to its full potential. Whereas, if plastic (non-bio) and soil (bio) waste are mixed, the hazardous dioxins and bisphenols would mix into the    
soil making it less fertile and more dangerous for plant growth.
   <br>
   <br>
When interviewing committee representatives, I have gained a wider range of knowledge based on sole experiences and practical knowledge from
the subjects. I also knew that a website would be a very viable solution with respect to costs and efforts, minimum skills required, and the 
possibilities of organized planning to meet developmental goals. Also, I have chosen a website since multimedia can be used (such as photos, 
animations and videos). Additionally, I could modify the aesthetics in a website to improve the visual appeal. Lastly, the website would be easier to 
maintain while it can be shared to multiple people as a link rather than a large video file or application.
