<h1 id="frankruhllibre"> The Importance of Sustainability</h1>
<h2 id="lobster">Brief:</h2>
<p id="roboto">
The trend of sustainability has risen over the years as a method of providing needs for both the 
future and the present. While exploring under environmental exploration, the logical and efficient
 use of resources such as water, clean air, and land provides solutions and innovative elements to 
 consider (which could solve other problems; for example, waste can be used to produce energy instead
  of being recycled). At the moment, energy efficiency and waste minimization are very viable strategies
   for the common man to follow. The philosophy of sustainability is also drawn toward the evaluation of social,
    economic and political systems to propose solutions. 

</p>

<h2 id="lobster">Relevance:</h2>
<p id="roboto">
From a common viewpoint, sustainability intends to regulate the balance between the production/regeneration 
and the consumption of goods/resources (natural or manmade). This discipline ranges from multiple angles of 
humanities in understanding the world around us from social, economic, political, geographical, historical and
 business related perspectives. Scientific fields are also included such as those associated with environmental
  study, geneticists, medicine and chemist specialists which have a common tie of creating a reliable and effective
   solution to a certain problem. 

</p>
<h2 id="lobster">Historical Background:</h2>
<p id="roboto">
From a historical viewpoint, sustainability hadn’t risen in prominence until the 20th CE where the United Nations was 
founded after the 2nd World War (1945). The establishment of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO) promoted the understanding of humans interacting with the world and the causality that followed. 
Factors such as overpopulation, pollution, deforestation, and fossil fuels (instead of improving the effectiveness of solar
 and wind power) grew in popularity later on since 1987, 30 years ago. Infact, it was implicitly mentioned in 1798 in 
 “An Essay on the Principle of Population “ by Thomas Malthus (arguing that populations grew quicker than resources). 
 Also, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 was first to explicitly define sustainable development.

</p>
<h2 id="lobster">Main point:</h2>
<p id="roboto">
The concept of sustainability binds to the point that numerous ideas, fields and disciplines are interconnected which 
explicitly or implicitly relate to many worldwide/domestic issues. In the case of plastic pollution, reducing the use 
of plastic or finding productive uses of plastic for the good of the environment provides more focused results which 
would be useful in the long run of humanity. Also, with improvement in waste management practices, the reduction of land 
pollution, ingestion, and disease would occur while productive benefits would be reaped.
