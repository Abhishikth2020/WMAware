<h1 id="frankruhllibre"> The Significance of Waste Conservation </h1>

<p id="roboto">
Even though plastic pollution can be managed, regulating the use of other wastes along  
with plastic is also beneficial for the environment and for people. It is also helpful for 
improving productivity and organizational skills which are important for task management.
With this in mind, the implementation of waste management in  
residencies is symbiotic to the environment and to personal development (since discipline is required 
for a life with purpose, the activity of managing waste would become a habit over time). But, when  
speaking about managing waste from a broader perspective, developed countries such as US and Canada
have more effective methods of management and segregation compared to developing counntries (since 
resources are needed).

It is also natural that people expect certain reward incentives for performing tasks. When people are motivated through
a factor/reward (such as money in buy-back programs to dispose more waste), more action would be creted. However, 
if there is no reward, less action would take place. Thwerefore, incentives do work but it is crucial for people to protect the
environment out of pure intent. This would allow people to volunteer beyond their liimits to preserving the environemnt/
Also, spreading the awareness of the need to implement waste regulation methods is beneficial for change. With these,
a socially renowned setting would be created with the improvement in environmental awareness.

<p id="roboto">“High-income countries have very effective waste management systems; mismanaged waste – 
and plastic that ends up in the oceans – is therefore very rare. Poor waste management across many 
middle- and low-income countries means that these are the main sources of global ocean plastic pollution.”
 - Our World in Data
</p>
<p id="roboto">
When looking at waste management from a global perspective, the significance of waste 
management is exaggerated to the point where a country’s economy and reputation can be affected, 
determining its competitive position compared to other neighboring countries. However, the availability 
of financial resources to initiate these methods is necessary to consider other than the plain fact that 
countries are “irresponsible” or “not environmentally aware” of their circumstances. Different scenarios 
might happen which would positively or negatively affect the use of methods; 
however, it is always fundamentally and morally important to consider whether we are up 
to our standards when managing waste. The amount of blame would be reduced and the frequency of action would increase. 
</p>

<p id="roboto">
Inadequately disposed waste can be found in uncontrolled landfills to dumps which can seep
into the environment through water bodies and air (winds, tides, and other vectors). Countries such as New Zealand, 
North America, Europe and Australia, have effective waste management with adequate and safe
infrastructure (controlled dumping sites). The contrast between high income to low 
income countries is also notable. For example, in 
South Asia and Subsaharan Africa, 80-90 percent of plastic is improperly 
disposed off (leading to ocean pollution and its accumulation in other countries through wind, water currents, and vectors).

However, when magnifying from a global perspective to a precise point, India is in need to 
address its waste management strategies. With cities generating 62 million tonnes of solid waste per annum, the challenges 
of managing waste effectively are exaggerated due to rapid urbanization (with 377 million people living in urban settlements).
Also, with only 43 million tonnes (MT) of waste collected (12 MT treated and 31 MT of waste ending up in landfills), the reckless 
maintenance of dumpyards and the littering of waste are catalysts for inefficient waste management in India. 
</p>

<p id="roboto">
“More than three-fourths of the municipal budget on solid waste management goes into collection and transportation, which 
leaves very little for processing/resource recovery and disposal.” - Indian Express
</p>

<p id="roboto">
Also, the lack of recycling and segregation practices in most Indian WM systems is persistent. However, there is hope in using 
waste to produce energy supply for power in households and to power factories (with renewable energy sources being a sustainable 
aspect of waste management). Even though energy can be created, the separation of biodegradable from non-biodegradable material is 
needed at first. Under the process of Biomethanation (processing bio waste), 50% of solid waste would be segregated at hand where 
biogas can be produced (with methane and CO2). 
</p>

<p id="roboto">
“Methane is a harmful gas if released in the environment as it is one of the four major gases responsible for global warming. 
But it is an excellent fuel.”“ - Indian Express
</p>

<p id="roboto">
Currently, there are 250 Biomethanation plants in India converting bio waste to manure (for plants and healthy soil) and energy 
(through methane). While these plants may be slightly ineffective for a long term use (due to methane being a pollutant), the 
significant application in domestic usage (to power street lights and save energy) is possible.

</p>
<p id="roboto">
“A major new attempt at scientific management of solid waste has come forth again from Pune where the Pune Municipal Corporation and Noble 
Exchange Environment Solutions, a private company have come together to commission a bio-CNG plant with a capacity to convert 300 TPD of 
biodegradable waste into 15,000 standard cubic meters of bio-CNG.” - Indian Express
</p>
<p id="roboto">
Also, the company has ambitions to produce enough fuel for powering transportation (with fuels) and public lighting systems. 
It is also astonishing to know that the plant is capable of accepting 200 TPD of waste to produce 2MW of power and 40 TPD of manure.
Segregating bio-medical waste with a common facility every 150 km; however, is hazardous waste management.
Also, incinerating (burning) and solidifying to treat waste must be in check since it contributies to 97.8% of landfill 
waste and 88% of incinerable waste in India. The importance of processing waste instead of disposing it uncontrollably is crucial to 
ensure smart waste management facilities and methods are in place. E-waste is also involved (since it generates toxic 
materials upon disposal which are non-biodegradable) which need to be recycled and reused rather than disposed to harm the environment
(this also applies to other non-biodegradable waste such as plastic and paper). Economically speaking, with a 110,000 Crore plastic 
manufacturing industry, the government of India has taken many initiatives to reduce the use of plastic less than 50 microns.

Recent government efforts to manage waste effectively are very strong. Since 
the 1986 National Environment Policy Act, many steps took place  to increase environmental consciousness in people with new waste management rules 
in 2016. The efforts of Urban Local Bodies, Municipalities and various cities (such as Pune) also highlight the need to rise above plastic pollution 
and to create a strong working economy (providing jobs to people who segregate waste and certified inspectors). Also, with the decision to ending 
plastic use by 2022 (implemented in 2018) to the contributions from the CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) and NGT (National Green Tribunal), the 
improvement of waste management strategies throughout time (within the past 5 years) is promising 
and will be even more if more people take individual action:
</p>

<br>

<ul id="roboto" style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li>Keep separate bins for different kinds of waste (primarily wet and dry waste</li>
<li>Keep separate bins for plastic and other dry waste and frequently dispose wet waste</li>
<li>Raising awareness of waste management in a community by holding a conference or talking to neighbors are effective to ensure more awareness among people</li>
<li>Wet waste is food and organic waste which can smell (so regular disposal is important)</li>
<li>Dry waste is paper, plastic, styrofoam, metal, rubber and other non-biodegradable products (which will not smell or attract insects)</li>
<li>When conserving dry waste which had a wet waste component, cleaning it is important (with water/soap if oil is present)</li>
<li>Donate unneeded items which are in usable condition to organizations/charities</li>
<li>Reduce the use of plastic at home and find alternatives (such as jute bags or vintage ink pens; also reduce the amount of straws used)</li>
<li>Use compost as fertilizer for plants (reduces 30% of waste in households and is beneficial for plant growth)</li>

<ul>
<li>When creating compost, putting it in a bin and covering it with newspapers or fallen leaves can suppress the smell</li>
<li>Smell from compost is a symbol of improper decomposition (breaking down organic material) and it indicates that 
there isn’t a proper balance in the compost: (from https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/composting/basics/compost-smells-bad.htm)
<ul>

<li>Too much of green (nitrogen) material and not enough brown material can lead to a foul smell; 
adding more brown material (leaves and newspapers) can reduce the smell
<li>Oxygen is needed for decomposition to take 
place at a balanced level (therefore, exposure to air is needed while adding dry leaves/grass can reduce over-compacting)  
<li>Regulating the amount of moisture by adding brown material (and moisture absorbing substances) can reduce the smell
<li>Summary: Balance green and brown material (green material decompose quicker than brown material)
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Purchase food in bulk and items that are not packed in plastic
<li>Follow the 3 R's: Reuse, Reduce and Recycle (for residents)
</ul>

On a final note, by practicing waste management, you are ahead of the crowd and making a significant contribution to the environment 
(which is needed). Also, an example for others to follow is set along with an improved personal daily routine (where responsibility and discipline are practiced 
providing stability in life). Today, many sustainable solutions are in place and are implementable; however, the boundary between expectation and result is action. 
This does not only apply to safeguarding the environment; but this is applicable to goal setting and achieving significant aspirations in life.
