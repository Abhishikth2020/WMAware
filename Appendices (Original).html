<li>Dry leaves are recycled my community</li>
<li>I store peels of vegetables which decompose weekly (also done by certain residents)</li>
<li>Many residents in my community recycle plastic (or give to truck)</li>
<li>Chemical decomposition products (powders) are used which cannot be used again as fertilizer (thrown in garden for faster decomposition)</li>
<li>Homemade natural biodegradable waste takes 2-4 days to decompose</li>
<li>Rotten vegetables are stored in plastic trash bags (separate decomposing bag) where they are decomposed</li>
<li>In the community, nobody throws trash anymore</li>
<li>There is a biochemist named Suresh</li>
<li>The whole community recycles in separate blue and green boxes </li>
<li>Green box is for wet trash</li>
<li>It is possible to generate biogas and make electricity out of dry leaves/trash (must not rain) - Done by GHMC (doesn’t throw trash)</li>
<li>Each community members decomposes their own waste (and all trash is collected at one place by the GHMC; they burn it (presently)</li>
<li>Unawareness among people (leave and dispose trash on the roads; harms community, society, nature and habitat) is the primary cause for plastic pollution</li>
<li>If people keep throwing plastic, it harms birds (this must be prohibited)</li>
<li>In Tamil Nadu, there are no plastic shopping bags (paper bag instead)</li>
<li>Vijetha (shopping complex) uses cloth bags</li>
<li>Decomposing dry leaves do not smell unlike vegetable and fruit remains (which smell when ripened off root).</li>
<li>People don’t have time/are lazy/don’t like to decompose (since it smells a lot). Some people still manage to do it in the community</li>
<li>Hydroponics - a subset of hydroculture, which is a method of growing plants without soil by instead using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent. Wikipedia</li>
<li>Suggests that the government must ban plastic bags (in the olden days, milk was bought using glass bottles)</li>
<li>Plastic usage during that time was less</li>
<li>If govt. stopped manufacturing plastic (by banning plastic manufacturing units), there would be less plastic pollution</li>
<li>PP endangered nature</li>
<li>Plastic goes into manholes during rain</li>
<li>MUST NOT be thrown in garbage/sewer (prevents flow of rainwater and blocks sewers)</li>
<li>Cattle (buffalos and dogs) eat plastic and have intestinal problems </li>
<li>Oceans also get contaminated (sea and beaches)</li>
<li>In Goa, many dolphins died and came on the shore</li>
<li>Govt. bans plastic but people still use plastic</li>
<li>In Tamil Nadu and Gujarat (Mizoramu, Sikkim and Goa), plastic manufacturing units were banned.</li>
<li>Narendra Modi in Goa, walked the shores of Mahabalipuram and picked up garbage (ship land between Bay of Bengal and the Great Salt Lake; took place in October 2019) (refer to this in website) (Times of India)</li>
<li>People should be more aware and take preventive measures (of all the mishaps taking place)</li>
<li>Govt drives must appeal more to citizens</li>

<ul id="roboto">
<li>Waste management is a broad term which can be divided into organic and inorganic waste because it is important since the resources are limited and that segregating is a must. Waste management is managing resources appropriately.</li>
<li>It takes effort. People feel that the efforts needed to manage waste are not worth the time. Rather, people would want to invest in something productive. People wouldn’t do it unless they are aware of the right intentions behind doing it.</li>
<li>Organic waste (fruit peels) are compacted. I haven’t done this in a while due to a weird experience. However, we don’t dump bio waste directly. Instead, we keep it in plants directly. I used to keep it in the soil directly; however, fertilizer is required. The soil I had was hard. By putting materials directly (adding water and bile) for decomposing, the process of decomposition would be faster.</li>
<li>In small villages in Kerala, there is inorganic waste in coconut trees.</li>
<li>Panchayats in those villages do not allow littering and plastic use.
</li>
<li>Villagers do not use plastic covers. Panchayat members throw plastic in the house if it is dispersed in public. There is a designated spot for throwing plastic.</li>
<li>Muthuvara - village which practices good waste management</li>
<li>In cities, people throw waste on the roads
</li>
<li>Usage of plastic has to be monitored carefully </li>
<li>Recycling plastic must be common</li>
<li>People buy things they don’t need (minimizing the use of natural resources is also effective)
</li>
<li>Using 2 bins is effective (one for groceries) if bio and non-bio waste is kept separately
</li>
<li>Put the repercussions of the consequences that would happen in some format (video, images, vivid descriptions)</li>
<li>Eating adulterated food (how many make an effort to minimize the effort)
</li>
<li>Practicing what you preach is important</li>
<li>Young generation has more impact on the world
</li>
<li>Do not use plastic trash bags Use paper/cloth instead</li>
<li>Basket: Jaggery, waste (organic) and composting (layering)
</li>
<li>Dig a pit and dump plastic waste (more effective and convenient</li>
</ul>

<ul id="roboto">
<li>Has 2 bins: 1 for plastic and 1 for bio</li>
<li>Bio waste is put in plants </li>
<li>Puts 1 kg of waste everyday into plants</li>
<li>All waste goes into outskirts and dump mashing is useless</li>
<li>Reuse and decompose</li>
<li>By recycling/decomposing, we are not contributing to pollution by dumping it into trash. By giving them to plants, we are providing healthy things to the plants</li>
<li>In apartments, if you manage it properly, there won’t be smell</li>
<li>Using kitchen waste, mixing with dry waste  and soil</li>
<li>Takes min 3 months to decompose if you keep in soil - black soil (natural fertilizer) forms (black gold) </li>
<li>Collect for 2-3 days</li>
<li>Does not use store bought chemical agents for dishwashing, uses soap nuts (vinegar, kimkudikan and glass)</li>
<li>Water, nimakai cut, 20 min boil, take outside and grind, 10 min boil, vinegar (100 ml), 5 min boil, stores, lasts for 2 months, no smell, grind, there will be a pleasant smell next day, available ones are bad (store bought chemicals)</li>
<li>Makes dishwash detergent/liquid and clothing detergent with soap nuts (seeds in it) - used for shampoo (natural)</li>
<li>Soap nuts can be bought online, general store or can grow on trees</li>
<li>Plastic causes pollution (takes 100ds of years to decompose)</li>
<li>Avoid plastic to the max extent possible</li>
<li>People do not manage waste since they feel it is a time taking process (little bothered about the environment)</li>
<li>On streets, there are plastic covers, and in market (even educated people ask for plastic bags)</li>
<li>Workers carry cloth bag</li>
<li>Educated people are causing more pollution (by using store provided plastic bags)</li>
<li>Cloth bag - 50g</li>
<li>Negligence: we neglect important things</li>
<li>Because of our actions, we are polluting the soil and farming animals and the future generations (animals are eating plastic and get intestinal problems/death)</li>
<li>One animal had 50kg plastic (there would be more plastic than fish) \</li>
<li>We can carry our own cloth bags when going anywhere (not just grocery stores), Aunty carries small cloth bags to pack grocery items</li>
<li>Change must come from us. If people contribute their own start towards the environment, everything would be great</li>
<li>People should be willing to make small changes</li></ul>
